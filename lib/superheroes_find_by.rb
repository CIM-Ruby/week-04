# Here is the original implementation of SuperHeroes#find_by method.
# 
# This will find all the SuperHeroes that match ANY of criteria. Look at the 
# file 'spec/superheroes_find_by.rb' and uncomment those tests and change this 
# method so that it finds superheroes that match all of the criteria.

def SuperHeroes.find_by(criteria)
  criteria.map do |field,value|
    find_all do |hero|
      hero[field] == value
    end
